# E-Commerce_db-dynamic-reports
Relational database for e-commerce with dynamic reporting using SSDT and SSRS. Enables efficient data management, real-time insights into sales, inventory, and customer behavior, improving business processes and decision-making.

## 📌 Project overview
The rapid development of modern technologies and the growing availability of the internet have transformed the way we conduct business.  
E-commerce has become an integral part of everyday life, enabling users to easily search, compare, and purchase products from the comfort of their homes.  

This project presents a **relational database for an e-commerce system** designed with **SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)** and integrated with **SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)** for **dynamic, interactive reporting**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop an **optimized relational database** for products, customers, orders, and transactions.  
- Ensure **data centralization, security, and integrity**.  
- Enable **fast queries and updates** for daily business operations.  
- Implement **dynamic SSRS reports** for real-time sales, inventory, and customer insights.  
- Support **data-driven decision-making** to improve efficiency and reduce errors.

## ⚠️ Challenges without optimized database
- ❌ **No centralized data** → duplicates, difficult searches, reduced productivity  
- ❌ **Weak KPI tracking** → unreliable and slow decision-making  
- ❌ **Limited access to relevant data** for employees  
- ❌ **High error risk** in inventory, pricing, and order processing  
- ❌ **Security & integrity issues** without controlled access

## 👥 System users
| User Group       | Role & Responsibilities |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| **Administrators** | Maintain database integrity, security, backups, performance |
| **Management**     | Use analytical reports for strategic decision-making |
| **Employees**      | Process orders, provide customer support (limited access) |
| **Customers**      | Indirect users generating data via orders, feedback, reviews |

## 📊 Business intelligence (BI)
Business Intelligence is implemented through **SSRS reports**, transforming raw data into actionable insights.  

Reports provide:  
- **Operational support** → daily business monitoring  
- **Strategic insights** → long-term planning
